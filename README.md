# covid19Dashboard

Dashboard created using Dash in Python that visualizes total confirmed cases, total fatalities, and active cases for all nations, each of which may be selected from a drop-down menu.

The Dash Python library is a powerful tool for building interactive dashboards that allow users to explore data and analyze trends. 

To develop a COVID-19 dashboard using the Dash library, the first step is to gather the data. The data is fetched from John Hopkins University COVID-19 repository. The data is then cleaned. This is done using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. The cleaned data can then be visualized using Plotly, which provides a wide range of chart types and customization options.

Once the data is ready, the dashboard can be built using Dash. Dash allows developers to create interactive components, such as dropdown menus and sliders, that allow users to explore the data in different ways. 

The dashboard displays data and statistics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and allows users to explore and analyze the data through interactive components.

Covid-19 dashboard can be used to track the spread of the virus, monitor the effectiveness of interventions, and inform decision-making at different levels of government and healthcare organizations.
